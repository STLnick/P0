# Compilers - P0

**Version Control**:
GitHub repo: https://github.com/STLnick/P0
(private repo but all commits are logged below)

**To run the program**:
First run 'make' in the root of the project to build 'P0'.
The executable is truly built and placed in `/bin`, however, a symlink will be available in the root directory too.

**Run command example**:

./P0 -> read from the keyboard until simulated EOF

./P0 < [ _file_ ] -> redirect from _file_ until simulated EOF, this tests keyboard input

./P0 [ _file_ ] -> read from _file_.sp2020

./P0 -h -> help
